#project-boilerplate

**Description**: Node Boilerplate for my [freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com "freecodecamp") projects

Objective: Build a Glitch app that is functionally similar to this: https://chrome-delivery.glitch.me.
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.
User Story: I can add a new book.
User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
